# 🎮 Idle Game Runner (Steam Edition)

A tiny Windows-only Python script that keeps your game "running" in the background — ideal for boosting Steam playtime hours.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Launches a Windows message box saying "Game Started!"
- Starts a background thread that simulates idle runtime
- Keeps the process alive, making Steam think the game is still running

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/Apelo0/Idle-Game-Runner/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
1. Copy `Idle-Game-Runner.exe` into your Steam game's install directory
2. Rename it to your game's name (for example `Idle-Game-Runner.exe` > `GhostOfTsushima.exe`)
2. Run the game on Steam
3. Press OK and let it run!

> ✅ Works best with games that don’t have anti-cheat or validation checks
> The Releases tab includes an already-compiled version using PyInstaller!
> ⚠️ Only tested on Windows with Steam games  

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system (https://python.org)
